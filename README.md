This project analyzes survey responses from non-major students at County College of Morris (CCM) to understand:

- Why students take computing courses (career-related, degree requirements, personal interest)
- Which enrolled courses generate the most interest in computing
- What specific computing areas students are most excited about (e.g., AI, Web Dev, Cybersecurity)

The insights will help guide recruiting and outreach strategies for the CCM IT department.
